% HYPOTHESIS
 % 1: MCTS is better than all other tree search algorithms
 % 2: Best first search is superior in deterministic/ stohastic games
 % 3: Breadth first search is superiror in the majority of xyz games


TODO:
Implement more data gathering code, to measure the depths of each search algorithms
Measure win rate

Get a basic breadth first search and best first search working properly
As well as minimax
