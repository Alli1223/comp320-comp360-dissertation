MCTS locality - Use other search techqiues to address this issue.
Using a cell weighting/penalty system to avoid the MCTS locality limitiation

Move the paper away from tree search techniques, and focus towards MCTS and it's variants.
Then possibly create a hyper heuristic of MCTS variants

Help importing other controllers into the framework


Summarise Hypothesis:

Analysis of different MCTS improvements for GVG-AI
What is the most effective modification to MCTS
Benchmarking MCTS variants for GVG-AI
Does any modifications to MCTS
