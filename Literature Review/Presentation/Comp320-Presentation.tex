\begin{frame}{About GVGAI}
	  What is the General Video Game AI (GVG-AI) Competition? \pause
	  \begin{itemize}
	      \item The GVG-AI is an AI competition that aims to create an AI that is able to play any game. \pause
	      \item There have been a few different AI competitions in the past. \pause
	      \item However most of the winning AI stratagies used in those games are very domain specific and it is often more about knowing the game than developing good general AI \pause
	  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{About the competiton}		
	\textbf{Game Concept} \pause
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The concept of my demake is a 2D space shooter, similar to Galaga but based on the modern game Star Citizen.  \pause
			\item The game will have a player ship at the bottom of the screen and will be able to fire projectiles at enemies that spawn at the top of the screen.\pause
			
			\item The player will loose health if hit by projectiles, but if the player kills enemy ships their score will increase.  \pause

			\item The aim of the game is to get the best score. \pause 	
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Challenges and goals}		
			\begin{itemize}
			\item The goal of GVGAI is to create a generally intelligent agent that is able to win any game it is placed in, when it doesn't know the game.
			\item During the tournament a completely new set of games are used, to avoid the agents becoming too deomain specific.
			\item Another challenge is the time limit that an agent can choose an action, this avoids the agent spending too long deciding a task and not making an action.
		\end{itemize}
