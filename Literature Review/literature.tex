\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} Literature review will cover what questions I will be asking for my dissertation topic as well all the literature I have found that is related to my research questions.

\section{Research Questions}

%TODO: Simplify research questions
\begin{itemize}
    \item How does game tree search techniques compare for GVGAI?
    \item Where does GVGAI succeed best in set games?
    \item Where does each tree search technique do well in?
    \item What are the most challenging areas for GVGAI in the GVGAI competition?
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{What is General Video Game AI (GVGAI)?}

GVGAI is an AI competition framework, in which AI controllers are designed to be able to play any game it is given, even when it has never played that game before. \cite{perez2016GVGAICompetition}
