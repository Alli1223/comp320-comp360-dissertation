\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} Literature review will cover what questions I will be asking for my dissertation topic as well all the literature I have found that is related to my research questions.




\section{Research Questions}

%TODO: Simplify research questions
\begin{itemize}
    \item How does game tree search techniques compare for GVGAI?
    \item Where does GVGAI succeed best in set games?
    \item Where does each tree search technique do well in each game?
    \item What are the most challenging areas for GVGAI in the GVGAI competition?
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{What is General Video Game AI (GVGAI)?}

GVGAI is an AI competition framework, in which AI controllers are designed to be able to play any game it is given, even when it has never played that game before. The controllers are given allowed upto 40ms to compute the agents action(s) \cite{perez2016GVGAICompetition, GVGAI}.
The framework contains a library of 2D Java based video games some of which are based of classic arcade games, there are currently as of writing this, 62 games that AI controllers can be tested on.

\subsection{Analyzing the Robustness of General Video Game Playing Agents}
This paper 
\cite{perez2016analyzing}

\subsection{Efficient Implementation of Breadth First Search for General Video Game Playing}
This paper proposes an efficient implementation of Breath First search, however it only works well for deterministic game sets.
The paper proposes a method of BFS where a node that has already been visited in other nodes will not be expanded, this is stored in a hash function.
The algorithm uses hash codes to improve the efficiency and performance.
